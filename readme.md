# This project was built using VanillaCSS and VanillaJS.

I used linear gradients for the background styling.
I used 'span' to design the play button and implemented the clip path to transform the 'span' into a polygon.
I added transform and transition to dissolve 1 'span' and turn the other 'span' into a triangle and have a smooth animation.

I added a json file so there can be data to be fetched and add more functionality to the play, backward and forward buttons using the fetched data from the artist.

I used the audio object to implement audio in the HTML which can then be utilized using scripts. 
**Audio properties that were used here were:**
* currentTime
* duration
* src

**Audio methods used were:**
* play()
* pause()
